# Ricochet

Unity iPad/iPhone 2-player game.

Goal of the game :
> Be the last one standing!

This is a turn based game, each turn players can perform 3 actions :
>  1 - Move around using the joystick
> 
>  2 - Aim their pistol by draging their finger
> 
>  3 - Shoot a bullet by pressing the shoot button next to the joystick

What makes this game interesting :
> This is a memory game, bullets will bounce on exactly 1 surface before sticking to the second surface. They are then freezed in time. Every time a player shoots a new bullet, his bullets that were frozen in time will continue their trajectory for 1 more bounce before freezing again.

> To enforce this dynamic, if a player kills the other with a bullet that was never frozen in time, he loses the game.

Unity Version :
